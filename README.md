# Commoditizing data integration alongside Airbyte

![logo](imgs/airbyte-logo.svg)
## What *is* Airbyte?

[Airbyte](https://airbyte.io/) soft-lauched in late September 2020 as an open-source data integration platform. It's backed by a friendly group of engineers, enthusiastic community contributions, and some [impressive seed funding](https://airbyte.io/articles/our-story/we-raised-a-5m-seed-round-with-accel-to-commoditize-data-integration/).

Their core product, a self-hosted EL(T) engine, effectively addresses the established need for an enterprise-scale solution to moving enterprise-scale amounts of data.

My purpose here is to give a little background on what's exciting about Airbyte to organizations like us at [SLATE](https://slateco.io) and demonstrate how you can help commoditize data integration by contributing to Airbyte!

## Airbyte's Usefulness
I entered the data engineering space shortly after Airbyte came into being, and it seems that this coincidence has ended upu drastically simplifing my life as a junior data engineer. 

If Airbyte wasn't around to do my job, I'd probably be writing all of our clients' ETLs in Python (maybe trying to learn Luigi or Airflow) or maybe instead I'd be a shameful consultant and would have started suggesting to clients that they should pay a subscription to some low-code service that likely exceeds their use-case, like Talend.

Thankfully, Airbyte does exist. At SLATE, we leverage their core ELT tool in dozens of use-cases to automatically move data at a functionally arbitrary scale, paying for nothing but the virtual machine that runs Airbyte.

So, to be more concise:
- Airbyte allows us to avoid the potentially unsavory hours involved in repurposing Python code to build one-off ELTs that are fast, schedulable, and reliable
- Unlike many ELT services with subscription or usage-based pricing, Airbyte's open-source ETL engine is freely customizable and easily integrated into your own application or simple use-case
